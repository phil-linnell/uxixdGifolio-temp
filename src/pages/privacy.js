      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This website collects only anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of the pages you viewed. Third party websites like Facebook and Twitter may know you visited this website, if you use their services. UXIXD has no access or control over that information. Your data is never shared with third parties except to help deliver services of UXIXD.</p>

      <h2>What personal information is collected?</h2>
      No personal information is collected. The safest way to deal with personal data is to not collect it in the first place and so this website doesn’t use any email forms, signups, comments or under-the-radar cookies or tracking.

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>Visits to this website is measured using Google Analytics, which places cookies in your browser history. This records what pages you view within this website, how you arrived at this website and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous. The information collected from Google Analytics helps us understand what parts of this website is doing well, how people arrive at this website and so on. Like most websites, this information is used to make improvements. You can read more about Google Analytics or opt out if you wish.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>This website is hosted on some of the most secure and dependable servers on the internet. Siteground is the web host of this website, which has a number of security features to help prevent intrusion.</p>

      <p>On this website itself, the most up-to-date security hardening software is used, and all web traffic is encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate – that’s the bit which adds a padlock into the browser’s address bar.</p>

      <h2>Any questions?</h2>
      <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please write to us by email at privacy@uxixd.com. Thank you.</p>
